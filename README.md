# Lifestyle-Diabetes-Risk

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze how lifestyle choices influence the risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes**. By leveraging **machine learning models**, we assess various factors such as **exercise frequency, sleep duration, BMI, and pre-existing health conditions** to predict diabetes risk levels. The study provides insights into risk distribution and helps in early risk detection.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and transformation of categorical data.
- **Risk Scoring System:** Assigning risk categories based on lifestyle and health factors.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing and evaluating Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations:** Insights through data-driven graphs and confusion matrices.

## 🔍 Objective
To develop a **data-driven approach** for early diabetes risk assessment, aiding individuals in making informed lifestyle changes.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
